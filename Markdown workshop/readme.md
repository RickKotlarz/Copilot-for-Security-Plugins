## Introduction

This workshop is designed to help you get up to speed with Microsoft Security Copilot. It offers hands-on experience in using Markdown, which can significantly enhance how our Large Language Models (LLMs) reason through data and format the results you receive.

## Reccomendations

It's highly reccomended that you review the following two pages prior to starting these modules.
 - [Prompting in Microsoft Security Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/prompting-security-copilot)
 - [Create effective prompts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/prompting-tips)

## What is markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language developed by John Gruber in 2004 that is used to format plain text. It allows you to easily add formatting elements such as headers, lists, links, images, bold or italic text, and more, using simple symbols or characters. The goal of Markdown is to make writing content more efficient, while keeping the text readable in its raw form.

## Why use markdown?
Using delimiters within Markdown can significantly help Large Language Models (LLMs) better understand a user's intent and the desired output by providing structure and clarity in the text.

1. Clear Separation of Content - Markdown delimiters like headers, bullet points, and code blocks help LLMs distinguish important sections. Example: Using a header (# Summary) signals critical points for prioritized processing.
2. Enhancing Context Recognition - Markdown highlights key sections, aiding LLMs in identifying priorities. Example: An ordered list (1. Step 1) helps the LLM understand the sequence of actions.
3. Distinguishing Between Input and Output - Code blocks (triple backticks) help LLMs differentiate between regular text and specialized content. Example: Wrapping code in code blocks allows the LLM to focus on syntax and logic.
4. Highlighting Intent with Emphasis - Markdown emphasis (bold/italic) guides LLMs on important parts of the input. Example: Important tells the LLM to prioritize that word in the response.
5. Prompting LLMs with Specific Formatting - Markdown formatting can guide LLMs to analyze content effectively, like tables for structured data. Example: A table prompts the LLM to treat data as distinct units.
6. Facilitating Conditional Output - Delimiters help LLMs structure responses. Example: A list (- Task 1, - Task 2) leads to a more organized, itemized response.
