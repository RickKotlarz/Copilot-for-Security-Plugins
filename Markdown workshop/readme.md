## Introduction

This workshop is designed to help you get up to speed with Microsoft Security Copilot. It offers hands-on experience in using Markdown, which can significantly enhance how our Large Language Models (LLMs) reason through data and format the results you receive.

## Reccomendations

It's highly recommended that you review the following two pages prior to starting these modules.
 - [Prompting in Microsoft Security Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/prompting-security-copilot)
 - [Create effective prompts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/prompting-tips)

## What is markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language developed by John Gruber in 2004 that is used to format plain text. It allows you to easily add formatting elements such as headers, lists, links, images, bold or italic text, and more, using simple symbols or characters.

## Why use markdown?
Markdown improves human readability and acts as a delimiter, helping Large Language Models (LLMs) better understand user intent and desired output by providing structure and clarity.

Using Markdown provides:
 - Clear separation of content
 - Enhancing context recognition
 - Distinguishing between input and output
 - Highlighting intent with emphasis
 - Prompting LLMs with specific formatting
 - Facilitating conditional output
