# Copilot-for-Security-Plugins

This repository offers examples of KQL queries, Microsoft Graph, and API-based plugins for use with Copilot for Security (also known as Security Copilot). It also serves as a place to host additional plugins that I have found useful. For further resources, please refer to Microsoft's official repository: [https://github.com/Azure/Copilot-For-Security](https://github.com/Azure/Copilot-For-Security).
